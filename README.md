# Simple-User-Interactive-Game
A simple game of list-value-assignment. This is my first real Python project where I applied my Python Knowledge on User-Interaction, Data Structures, and Control Flow.

Brief Description of the Game :

The user adds 2 values: index position and a value. Then the program assigns the value to the index position element of the current list provided. After each round of assignments, the user chooses whether to continue the game or not.

P.S : This is one of the projects that I built over my training over the Complete Python 3 Bootcamp by Jose Portilla on Udemy.
